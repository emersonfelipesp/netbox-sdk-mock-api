# NetBox SDK

`netbox_sdk` is a standalone Python library for connecting to NetBox over its REST API. It is the shared core used by both the CLI and the TUI, but it can also be imported independently in any Python project.

The SDK exposes three layers:

- `NetBoxApiClient` for low-level async request control
- `api()` / `Api` for a higher-level async facade with PyNetBox-style workflows
- `typed_api()` for a versioned typed client backed by committed Pydantic models

## Modules

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `netbox_sdk.config` | Config model, profile persistence, auth header construction |
| `netbox_sdk.client` | Async HTTP client and connection probe |
| `netbox_sdk.facade` | Async convenience API for apps, endpoints, records, and detail routes |
| `netbox_sdk.typed_api` | Versioned typed client factory |
| `netbox_sdk.models` | Committed generated Pydantic models for supported NetBox releases |
| `netbox_sdk.typed_versions` | Committed generated typed endpoint bindings |
| `netbox_sdk.http_cache` | Filesystem cache with TTL/stale-if-error support |
| `netbox_sdk.schema` | OpenAPI schema loading and indexing |
| `netbox_sdk.services` | Dynamic request resolution |
| `netbox_sdk.plugin_discovery` | Runtime plugin/custom-object API discovery |

## Installation

```bash
pip install netbox-sdk
```

You do not need the optional CLI or TUI extras to use `netbox_sdk` as a Python
dependency.

## Quick start

```python
import asyncio
from netbox_sdk import api


async def main():
    nb = api("https://netbox.example.com", token="your-token")

    device = await nb.dcim.devices.get(42)
    if device is not None:
        print(device.name)

asyncio.run(main())
```

If you want raw HTTP control instead of the facade, use `NetBoxApiClient` directly.

## Plugins and custom objects

Use `async_api()` when you want the facade to select the connected NetBox schema
and enrich it with runtime resources. It discovers plugin REST collections under
`/api/plugins/` and public ObjectType resources advertised by
`/api/core/object-types/`.

```python
from netbox_sdk import async_api

nb = await async_api("https://netbox.example.com", token="your-token")
widgets = await nb.plugins.custom.widgets.all().to_list()
```

The SDK supports plugin/custom objects that expose standard REST list/detail
endpoints. Private models or plugin data without a REST endpoint are skipped.

## Typed SDK

Use `typed_api()` when you want request and response validation plus IDE-visible
endpoint models.

```python
from netbox_sdk import typed_api

nb = typed_api(
    "https://netbox.example.com",
    token="your-token",
    netbox_version="4.5",
)
```

Supported release lines:

- `4.6`
- `4.5`
- `4.4`
- `4.3`

Patch versions normalize to the matching release line, for example `4.5.5` maps
to `4.5`.
